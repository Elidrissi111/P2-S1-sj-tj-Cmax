Instances of the scheduling problem P2,S1|sj,tj|Cmax

The problem P2,S1|sj,tj|Cmax, involves two identical parallel machines with a single server in charge of
loading and unloading operations of jobs. Each job has to be loaded by the server before being processed on one
of the two machines and unloaded by the same server after its processing. No delay is allowed between loading
and processing, and between processing and unloading. The objective function involves the minimization of the
makespan. This problem generalizes the classical parallel machine scheduling
problem with a single server which performs only the loading (i.e., setup) operation of each job.
